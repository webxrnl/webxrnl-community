# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating, you
have to agree out [code of conduct].

[code of conduct]: https://github.com/webxrnl/webxrnl-meata/blob/master/.github/code_of_conduct.md

To get started, fork the repository and clone your fork

    git clone --origin github/<your-username> git@github.com:<your-username>/webxrnl-internal.git
    git remote add github/mkungla git@github.com:mkungla/webxrnl-internal.git

Make your changes and push them to your repository. You can use a branch if you like.

    git push -u <branchname>

Remember you might have to rebase sometimes.

    git fetch --all
    git rebase  github/mkungla master

At this point you're waiting on us. We love comments on pull requests. Tell us what you have changed and why. We may suggest
some changes, improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Follow our style guide.
* Write a good commit message.
